      <h2>Intro</h2>
      <p>
        Tries are mostly used in dictionary word searches, search engine
        auto-suggestions, and IP routing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Insert: For inserting a word having n characters, we just need to loop
        through n characters, so time complexity is O(n)
      </p>
      <p>
        Search: Similar to Insertion, we only need to loop through all the
        characters of the word to search it. So time complexity is O(n), where n
        is number of characters in the word.
