    <p>
      In problems where we deal with
      <strong>sorted arrays (or LinkedLists)</strong> and need to find a set of
      elements that fulfill certain constraints, the Two Pointers approach
      becomes quite useful. The set of elements could be a pair, a triplet or
      even a subarray. For example, take a look at the following problem:
    </p>
    <script src="./pair_with_targetsum.js"></script>
    <script src="./remove_duplicates.js"></script>
    <script src="./make_squares.js"></script>
    <script src="./search_triplets.js"></script>
  </body>
